This project was developed in the context of [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ua.pt/en/uc/12287) curricular unit, part of the Computer Science Bachelor at [Aveiro University](https://www.ua.pt/). It was lectured by [Lu√≠s Filipe de Seabra Lopes](https://www.ua.pt/en/p/10314261) and [Diogo Nuno Pereira Gomes](https://www.ua.pt/en/p/10331537) during the 2021/2022 school year.

# About the project

We were asked to develop code related to tree search to suit the different functions previously given in the tpi.py file. 

For this project, we only used python and VSCode as a code editor.
